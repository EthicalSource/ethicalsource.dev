It shall hold an Ordinary Meeting once each year. It may also hold an extraordinary session whenever necessary, at the request of the Board or at least of one-fifth of its members.

The General Assembly shall be considered valid with a quorum of at least one third of voting members.

Members may participate in the General Assembly remotely using electronic means (e.g. videoconferencing).

The Board of Directors shall announce to the members by electronic means the date of the General Assembly at least 30 days in advance. The formal notification of the General Assembly, including the agenda, shall be sent by electronic means to each member at least 10 days prior to the date of the meeting.

<h3 class="fancy-subtitle">article 8</h3>

The General Assembly:

<h3 class="fancy-subtitle">article 9</h3>

The General Assembly is presided over by the President of the Board of Directors. The President may delegate this responsibility to another Board member.

<h3 class="fancy-subtitle">article 10</h3>

Decisions of the General Assembly shall be taken by a majority vote of the voting members present or participating remotely using electronic means.

If the total number of voting members in the Organization, regardless of whether they are present or not, is less than 20, then the Organization will implement a modified consensus based decision making process for all matters the General Assembly is to vote on. In this modified consensus based decision making approach, any voting member will be able to prevent consensus from being reached by voting against taking any action. However, if the Board of Directors unanimously votes in favor of taking the action, they can choose to override the General Assembly only if no more than 2 people prevented the General Assembly from reaching consensus.

If the General Assembly is comprised of more than 20 voting members, then the Organization will utilize a voting system for decision making where any action the General Assembly requires a vote. Unless otherwise specified, in order for a vote to pass, the vote must reach simple majority.  In case of deadlock, the President shall have the deciding vote.

Decisions concerning the amendment of the Bylaws and the dissolution of the Organization must be approved by both a two-third majority of the members present or participating remotely, and all of the Founding Members present or participating remotely.

<h3 class="fancy-subtitle">article 11</h3>

Votes are by a show of hands. Voting can also take place by secret ballot, if at least one member requests it. Members may vote using electronic means. Members may vote by proxy by giving another Active Member or another member with voting rights the authority to vote on their behalf. The Board must be notified that a proxy will be voting in an Active Member’s place at least 24 hours before a vote is to take place or the General Assembly is to meet. This notification must include the name of the Active Member who will be acting as the proxy.
