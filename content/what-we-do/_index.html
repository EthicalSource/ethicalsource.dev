<h2>The Ethical Stack</h2>

<p>
  The fundamental premise of our work is that promoting justice and equity in tech starts "at home," within our open source communities, and radiates outward: to collaborators, adopters, users, all the way down to the people who are directly or indirectly impacted by the technologies we bring into the world.
</p>

<p>
  This is the philosophy behind the Ethical Stack.
</p>

<img src="/images/projects/ethical-stack/ethical-stack-web.png">

<p>
  The Ethical Stack is a layered approach to bringing ethical considerations to open source. By combining layers, open source communities can choose the tools that best suit their needs and reflect their shared values.

<h2>How We Work</h2>

<p>We are proud of our innovative way of working:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Our projects are carried out through special-purpose working groups.</li>
  <li>Members can propose, lead, and participate in working groups according to their interest or expertise.</li>
  <li>Working groups are volunteer-led, with support from one or more Board sponsors.</li>
  <li>Working groups can request funds for expert consultations.</li>
  <li>We work ethically, collaboratively, iteratively, and openly.</li>
</ul>

<p>We center the <a href="/what-we-believe/">Ethical Source Principles</a> in all of the work we do.</p>
