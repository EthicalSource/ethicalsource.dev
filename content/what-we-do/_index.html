<h2>The Ethical Stack</h2>

<p>
  The fundamental premise of our work is that working for justice and equity in tech starts "at home," within creator communities, and radiates outward from there: to collaborators, adopters, users, all the way down to what we call collateral users– the people who are most affected by these technologies.
</p>
  
<p>
  This is the concept behind what we call the "Ethical Stack"-- a comprehensive strategy layering codes of conduct, transparent governance, explicit social contracts, and ethical licenses.
