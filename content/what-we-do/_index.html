<h2>The Ethical Stack</h2>

<p>
  The fundamental premise of our work is that working for justice and equity in tech starts "at home," within creator communities, and radiates outward from there: to collaborators, adopters, users, all the way down to the people who are most affected by these technologies.
</p>

<p>
  This is the philosophy behind the Ethical Stack, a comprehensive, layered approach to centering ethics in open technologies. By adopting and adapting layers, such as codes of conduct, transparent governance, social contracts, and ethical licenses, open source communities can center and support their shared values in all the work they do.

<h2>How We Work</h2>

<p>We are proud of our innovative way of working:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Our projects are carried out through special-purpose working groups.</li>
  <li>Members can propose, lead, and participate in working groups according to their interest or expertise.</li>
  <li>Working groups are volunteer-led, with support from one or more Board sponsors.</li>
  <li>Working groups can request funds for expert consultations.</li>
  <li>We work ethically, collaboratively, iteratively, and openly.</li>
</ul>

<p>We center the <a href="/what-we-believe/">Ethical Source Principles</a> in all of the work we do.</p>
