<h2>The Ethical Stack</h2>

<p>
  The fundamental premise of our work is that working for justice and equity in tech starts "at home," within creator communities, and radiates outward from there: to collaborators, adopters, users, all the way down to what we call collateral usersâ€“ the people who are most affected by these technologies.
</p>
  
<p>
  This is the philosophy driving what we call the "Ethical Stack"-- a comprehensive, layered approach including codes of conduct, transparent governance, social compacts,and ethical licenses.

<h2>How We Work</h2>

<p>We are proud of our innovative way of working:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Our projects are carried out through special-purpose working groups.</li>
  <li>Members can propose, lead, and participate in working groups according to their interest or expertise.</li>
  <li>Working groups are volunteer-led, with support from one or more Board sponsors.</li>
  <li>Working groups can request funds for expert consultations.</li>
  <li>We work ethically, collaboratively, iteratively, and openly.</li>
</ul>

<p>We strive to center the <a href="/what-we-believe/">Ethical Source Principles</a> in all of the work we do.</p>
