<h2>Our Community</h2>

<p>
  We are a diverse and global community of nearly 300 members, including open source software developers, legal specialists, NGO and non-profit leaders, activists, writers, and human rights workers. We work to ensure that the perspectives and needs of people from traditionally underrepresented or undervalued groups are centered in everything we do.
</p>

<p>Our community strives to be safe, welcoming, and equitable. Guidelines for participation in our online spaces, and details of how we enforce these guidelines, are enumerated in our <a href="/governance/code-of-conduct/">Code of Conduct</a>.
</p>

<p>We believe that open, transparent, consensus-based, and representative governance is essential to the health and sustainability of our community and our work. Our governance framework is described in our <a href="/governance/bylaws">bylaws</a>.
