<h2>Our Mission</h2>

<p>
Our mission is to empower open source communities to ensure that their work is being used for social good and in service of human rights. We are building tools to promote fair, ethical, and equitable protections and standards for everyone who contributes to, benefits from, or is impacted by open source technologies.
</p>

<h2>Our Community</h2>

<p>
  We are a diverse and global community of over 250 members, including open source software developers, legal specialists, NGO and non-profit leaders, activists, writers, and human rights workers. Our members actively contribute to (or even lead) our projects, and work to ensure that the perspectives and needs of people from traditionally underrepresented or undervalued groups are centered in everything we do.
</p>

<p>Our community strives to be safe, welcoming, and equitable. Guidelines for participation in our online spaces, and details of how we enforce these guidelines, are enumerated in our <a href="/governance/code-of-conduct/">Code of Conduct</a>.
</p>

<p>We believe that open, transparent, consensus-based, and representative governance is essential to the health and sustainability of our community and our work. Our governance framework is described in our <a href="/governance/bylaws">bylaws</a>.
