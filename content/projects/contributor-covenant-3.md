Contributor Covenant is more than a code of conductâ€”- it's a foundational document that has transformed the practice of open source around the world. Contributor Covenant promotes diversity, equity, and inclusivity in open source communities, which have traditionally excluded marginalized contributors and been dominated by white American men.

Contributor Covenant is a living document that continues to evolve in response to the changing needs of open source communities around the globe. The Contributor Covenant 3.0 project represents the next stage in this evolution, through collaboration with industry experts in community governance and code of conduct enforcement.
