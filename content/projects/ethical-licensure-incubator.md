Ethical licensure is in its early stages, and through our partnership with [Corporate Accountability Lab](https://corpaccountabilitylab.org) (CAL), OES is uniquely positioned to foster innovation in this space. Our collaboration brings together CALâ€™s expertise at the intersection of intellectual property and human rights, with experts in the OES community who have specific experience in the open source ecosystem.

In addition to continuing to develop the [Hippocratic License](https://ethicalsource.dev), our Ethical Licensure Incubator also supports the development of other Ethical Source licenses, including the [At The Root Anti-Racist License](https://attheroot.dev) currently under development by software engineer and OES member [Dawn Wages](https://dawnwages.info).
