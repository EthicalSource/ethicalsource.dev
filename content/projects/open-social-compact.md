The Open Social Compact lets a community define the fundamental rights of all its participants; the specific responsibilities that participants have toward the community; and the privileges that are extended to participants who respect these rights and meet these responsibilities.

The Open Social Compact will also provide an innovative model for centering and elevating the safety and well-being not only of maintainers, collaborators, adopters, and users, but– most importantly– the safety and well-being of those who are most impacted by technologies we create, whether explicitly or implicitly, directly or indirectly, consensually or coercively.
