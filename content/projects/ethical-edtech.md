Ethical EdTech is a project that emerged out of a collaboration between Erin Glass (UCSD) and Nathan Schneider (CU Boulder), through CU Boulder's Media Enterprise Design Lab. 

The goal of the project is to promote ethical technology to educators, with lesson plans, curricula, and tools tailored for educational contexts. Ethical open source technologies have tremendous potential to empower educators (and students) to drive meaningful social change.
