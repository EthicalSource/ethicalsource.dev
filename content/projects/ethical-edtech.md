The e-learning market is growing very rapidly. As more companies develop and push their e-learning ecosystems to the market, more tutors, learners and enthusiasts are getting into these ecosystems.

Ethical EdTech is a project that emerged out of a collaboration between Erin Glass (UCSD) and Nathan Schneider (CU Boulder), through CU Boulder's Media Enterprise Design Lab. 

Open source technologies have tremendous potential to empower educators (and students) drive meaningful social change. The goal of the Ethical EdTech project is to develop, support, and promote tools, lesson plans, curricula, and other materials tailored for educational contexts.
