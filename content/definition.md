Software is considered Ethical Source if it meets the following criteria:

1. It can be freely used or combined with other software.
1. The source code is available, developed, and maintained in public view and welcoming of public contributions.
1. Its community of contributors is governed by a code of conduct that is consistently and fairly enforced.
1. It is distributed under a license that prohibits the software from being used any individual or organization which directly or indirectly facilitates, encourages, manipulates, coerces, or forces people to engage in behaviors that are in opposition to a specified framework of social good.
1. Creators have the right to solicit reasonable compensation from any commercial entity that benefits from the software.
1. Users of the software must, upon request, be provided with any and all data generated and stored from their usage of the software in either a human-readable or widely interoperable open format.

Maintaining this definition is the collaborative work of the [Ethical Source Working Group](/apply). Pull requests and issues to our [source code repository](https://github.com/ethicalSource/ethicalsource.dev) are encouraged.
