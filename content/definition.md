Software is considered **Ethical Open Source** (EOS) when it meets *all* of these criteria:

1. **It benefits the commons.** The license under which the software is released must not prohibit modification, derivative works, and linking or compiling with other software (unless under a copyleft provision), in the general spirit of open source distribution.
2. **It is created in the open.** The source code must be publicly available, developed and maintained in public view, and welcoming of public contributions (subject to review and approval by the software project’s maintainers.)
3. **Its community is welcoming and just.** The software project’s community of maintainers and contributors must publish clear rules for project governance and adopt a comprehensive code of conduct that is consistently and fairly enforced.
4. **It puts accessibility first.** If the software has a user interface, it must be designed with accessibility in mind, ensuring all software functionality is available to all users, including users who may rely on assistive devices.
5. **It prioritizes user safety.** The software must be designed with features and safeguards that minimize the risk of abuse or harm to others through the use of the software.
6. **It protects user privacy.** If the software collects end-user data, the entity running the software must, upon request,  delete or provide to the end-user any and all data generated and stored from the end-user’s usage of the software. All such data provided to the end-user must be in either a human-readable or widely interoperable open format.
7. **It encourages fair compensation.** The software project’s maintainers may, at their discretion, request remuneration in the form of code contributions, financial consideration, or other forms of voluntary support from organizations that derive commercial value from the software.

## Ethically Licensed Open Source

Software is considered **Ethically Licensed Open Source**\* (ELOS) if it meets *any* of the following additional criteria:

* It is distributed under the ["Hippocratic License"](https://firstdonoharm.dev), or a similar license that prohibits the redistribution of the software in modified, derivative, or collected work form from being relicensed to any individual or organization which directly or indirectly facilitates, encourages, manipulates, coerces, or forces people to engage in behaviors that are in conflict with the rights enumerated in the [United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights](https://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/).
* It is distributed under the ["Anti 996" license](https://996.icu/), or a similar license that prohibits the redistribution of the software in modified, derivative, or collected work form to any individual or organization that violates the [International Labor Standards Conventions and/or Recommendations](https://www.ilo.org/global/standards/introduction-to-international-labour-standards/conventions-and-recommendations/lang--en/index.htm) published by the International Labour Organization.
* It is distributed under an ["Atmosphere" license](https://www.open-austin.org/atmosphere-license/), or a similar license that prohibits the redistribution of the software in modified, derivative, or collected work form to any individual or organization that is materially and directly invested in operations or facilities that have significant negative impact on the global climate response, as [documented by the United Nations Climate Change Secretariat](https://unfccc.int/resource/climateaction2020/media/1308/unfccc_spm_2018.pdf).

\* *The term "open source" in this context refers to the broad experience of public and collaborative software development in contribution to the collective software commons. ELOS software licenses may or may not conform to the Open Source Initiative’s [conventional criteria for open source software licenses](https://opensource.org/osd-annotated).*
