Software is considered Ethical Source if it meets the following criteria:

1. Freely distributed with source code and can be used or combined with other software without a royalty or fee.
1. Developed in public view and welcoming of community contributions.
1. The community of contributors is governed by a code of conduct that is consistently and fairly enforced.
1. Creators have the right to prohibit use by individuals or organizations engaged in human rights violations or other behavior deemed unethical.
1. Creators have the right to solicit reasonable and voluntary compensation from the communities or institutions that benefit from the software.

Maintaining this definition is the collaborative work of the [Ethical Source Working Group](/apply).
