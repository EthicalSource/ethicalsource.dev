The Ethical Source working group is a community for open source maintainers and contributors, tech ethicists and advocates, licensing experts, and more to come together to strategize about ways to incorporate ethics into our open source work.

Our code of conduct is [here](/community-code-of-conduct) and is strictly enforced.

Note that this space is for collaboration and community, so if you're skeptical about Ethical Source, this is not the place for you.

Use this form to submit an application to join our Slack community via email. In your message, please provide a brief bio, an explanation of why you're interested in Ethical Source, and a Twitter handle (if you have one). This information helps us vet our members and keep the trolls at bay. Thank you in advance.
