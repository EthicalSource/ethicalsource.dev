Perhaps you remember Eric S. Raymond from his memorable essay "[The
Cathedral and the
Bazaar](http://www.catb.org/esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/)," or his [advice](http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html#not_losing)
to programmers on "not reacting like a loser," or his [enthusiasm for
guns](http://www.catb.org/~esr/guns/). Regardless, the legendary
open-source coder and commentator recently made a brief comeback to the
Open Source Initiative, an organization he co-founded in 1998. On
February 24, he [announced](http://lists.opensource.org/pipermail/license-discuss_lists.opensource.org/2020-February/021271.html)
on an OSI email list that "a wild co-founder appears" after being absent
for many years. By February 28, after [denouncing](http://techrights.org/2020/02/29/getting-banned-osi/)
the "political ratfucking" and "vulgar Marxism" he perceived to be
infecting the organization, he was removed from the list for violating
the code of conduct---the existence of which he had also railed against.
The previous month, also, Raymond's OSI co-founder Bruce Perens [withdrew
his
membership](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2020/01/03/osi_cofounder_resigns/)
over an apparently unrelated dispute about a software license.

These happenings are not unrelated, really. They are part of what has
been variously called "the [culture
war](https://words.steveklabnik.com/the-culture-war-at-the-heart-of-open-source)
at the heart of open source" and "the great open source [shake-up](https://katedowninglaw.com/2019/09/08/the-great-open-source-shake-up/)."
The disputes concern the decades-old legal technology at the heart of
the movement known variously as "free software" or "open source":
software licenses, particularly ones that turn proprietary code into a
common good. The conflicts at hand raise questions about ethics and
economics that the open source establishment believes have long been
answered and can be put away for good. Oh, and as programmer Steve
Klabnik [notes](https://words.steveklabnik.com/the-culture-war-at-the-heart-of-open-source)
in passing, without further explanation, "I personally think that gender
plays a huge role."

Richard Stallman, originator of the first free-and-open license,
resigned from the Free Software Foundation last year over comments
sympathetic to the late billionaire and molester Jeffrey Epstein. The
reputation of Creative Commons founder Lawrence Lessig also took a hit
for defending one of Epstein's enablers. Maybe all this set a mood,
heightened the intensity. It is probably not an accident that, in a
world where \~95% percent of GitHub contributors [identify as
male](https://opensourcesurvey.org/), several of the major partisans in
this culture war do not.

The bug that has been lurking in the open source codebase all along, for
the partisans, might be best summarized as neutrality. The OSI's [Open Source
Definition](https://opensource.org/osd) prohibits value judgments about
such things as "fields of endeavor," business models, and technology
stacks. The Free Software Foundation [puts the idea this
way](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html): "The freedom to run
the program as you wish, for any purpose." As long as the code remains
free and open, users---whether individual or corporate---should not be
constrained by a license in what they do or how they make money. Any
such constraint, the argument goes, is a slippery slope. During his
brief return to OSI's email lists, Raymond quoted Thomas Paine: "He that
would make his own liberty secure, must guard even his enemy from
oppression; for if he violates this duty, he establishes a precedent
that will reach to himself." Restrict others, and it will come back to
haunt you.

The challenges to this noble neutrality come in two forms: ethics and
economics.

On the first front, there is the [Ethical
Source Movement](https://ethicalsource.dev/), the doing of Ruby
developer and *Model View Culture* contributor Coraline Ada Ehmke,
against whom Raymond's worst recent vitriol has been directed. Ethical
Source builds on the [waves
of tech
workers](https://www.businessinsider.com/open-source-activism-ice-protests-open-source-initiative-2019-11)
rebelling against their bosses for taking contracts with the likes of
the Pentagon and ICE. Ethical Source offers its own counter-definition
to OSI's, outlining a type of license that allows developers to restrict
certain uses of their software. The handful of compliant licenses
prohibit violations of the [Universal
Declaration of Human Rights](https://firstdonoharm.dev/), for instance,
or [International Labour Organization
standards](https://996.icu/). The promise is some peace of mind for
programmers and perhaps a more ethical world; the danger is a mess of
unenforceable licenses whose prohibitions become impossible to keep
track of.

The second challenge is economic. This has long been a sore spot in open
source, which has largely outsourced its economics to companies that
might contribute employee time or grants to what projects are building.
Those companies also get a lot of the financial rewards, leaving many
contributors to offer their unpaid free time---[an unequally available
resource](https://modelviewculture.com/pieces/side-project-culture-opportunities-and-obstacles-for-marginalized-people-in-tech).
New lawyerly efforts, such as Heather Meeker's [PolyForm
Project](https://polyformproject.org/) and Kyle E. Mitchell's [License Zero](https://licensezero.com/),
offer menus of licenses designed to enable certain popular business
models. The code is still "source available"---anyone can read it, and
use it under certain terms---but there are restrictions to prevent some
company from taking it and profiting from others' work. One PolyForm
license permits only small businesses to use the software for free; big
corporations have to pay. Again, though, critics fear a free-for-all of
licenses that end up piling on restrictions and constraining the
commons.

Let me get back to that question of gender. From the perspective of the
"meritocracy" ideal familiar in tech culture---and [much
maligned in these
pages](https://modelviewculture.com/pieces/the-dehumanizing-myth-of-the-meritocracy)---the
neutrality principle makes sense. The spree of new license-making is
confounding. Forget money, forget ideology, we'll judge you by your
code! But through the lens of feminist thought, the challenges should
come as no surprise.

For instance, feminists have been [really
good](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1354570042000267608)
at noticing the undervalued, under-noticed labor propping up everything
else---because often it is women doing that stuff. Why not make sure
that people creating open code are also the ones receiving financial
benefits? Especially since women tend to have [far
less free time on their
hands](https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691163451/free-time),
getting paid matters. Meanwhile, feminists have stressed that there is
really no value-neutral, objective, meritocratic vantage point. All
knowledge is [situated](https://philpapers.org/archive/HARSKT.pdf).
There is no excuse for dispensing with ethical discussion and ethical
standards. Why not find reasonable ways for groups to articulate and
enforce the standards they hold?

The more you look at open source through a feminist lens---[as I've done
at greater length elsewhere](https://ntnsndr.in/tyranny)---the more
those two-decade-old certainties start to crack. We need to see those
cracks to build better tools. 

People often talk about open source as a commons, but if you go back and
[read Elinor Ostrom](https://wtf.tw/text/ostrom_in_silicon_valley.pdf)'s
studies on pre-digital practices of commoning around the world, you'll
find that there are some important things missing. (She didn't identify
her work with feminism, but she is still the first woman to have won the
Nobel in economics.) Ostrom recognized boundary-making as an essential
practice for commoners---defining who is a member and what purpose the
commons serves, whether economic, social, or otherwise. She also found
that a healthy commons depends on participants having a voice in
changing its rules and norms, which is a far cry from the
dictatorships-for-life that [tend to rule open
source](https://ntnsndr.in/implicit-feudalism). If open source listened
better to the legacy of commoning before it, projects wouldn't just
choose a license, they would start by adopting a [governance
structure](https://communityrule.info/) and finding a [place to manage
funds](https://docs.opencollective.com/help/about/introduction). They
would plan for economic and ethical self-determination---autonomy was
another principle Ostrom emphasized---rather than outsourcing those
matters to corporate whims.

Anyway, it is only natural that open source contributors should want to
hack the process, not just the software they write. For all that open
source has achieved, there is so much more that it hasn't. "The year of
the Linux desktop" has turned from an expectation to a joke, unless you
count Google's Android and Chromebooks. The open Web has closed shut.
Surveillance-powered corporate platforms have accumulated power because
of, not despite, open source. And the staggering homogeneity that still
persists among open source developers testifies to the talent and life
experience that their projects are missing.

If the early architects of open source feel threatened by a new
generation demanding more, that is probably a sign of progress.
