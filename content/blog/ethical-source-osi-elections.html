<p>The results of the 2020 <a href="https://opensource.org">Open Source Initiative</a> Board elections have just been released. I'd like to extend my congratulations to Josh Simmons, Megan Sanicki, and Italo Vignoli. I don't know Megan or Italo, but Josh has been great to work with over the past few months: humble, helpful, and collaborative. I'm looking forward to working with all of them as we move forward.</p>

<p>Although neither Tobie Langel (the other Ethical Source Movement candidate) nor I got enough votes to win board seats, we did collectively secure votes from 35% of the voting membership, which strengthens my belief that a significant portion of the open source community believes in the mission of Ethical Source.</p>

<p>The lesson to take away from this is that we have a journey ahead to reconcile our differences, but I am hopeful that we can achieve our goals through collaboration and good faith efforts.</p>

<p>I see the role of organizations like the OSI as essentially conservative; they play a vital stabilizing role in the open source ecosystem. The mission of the OSI is primarily around regulating licensing, although community-building, education, and public advocacy are among its stated goals.</p>

<p>Our goal in the Ethical Source Movement is to support creators with tools and processes that allow us to exercise the <a href="https://where.coraline.codes/talks/ethical-open-source/">ethical responsibilities</a> that come with what Edmund Berkeley called our greater-than-average impact on the world around us.</p>

<p>Ethical Source thus plays the role of an emerging change agent challenging the status quo. That is the essential conflict. But I strongly believe that our differences can largely be reconciled for the better of the community.</p>

<p>In this spirit, I have a few requests and suggestions for the new board:</p>

<ol>
	<li><p>I ask that they allow us to appoint an official liaison to the OSI to work toward resolving our differences and finding a path forward.</p></li>

	<li><p>I ask that they form a public, diverse, and widely representative working group to establish a mechanism for reviewing and potentially revising the OSD to ensure its continued utility and relevance now that its initial goals for open source viability have been met.</p></li>

	<li><p>I am concerned that the OSI is out-of-step with the growing needs of the OSS community, and that establishing a community advocate or developer relations position within the organization should be a high priority.</p></li>

	<li><p>Finally, after the abuse & harassment I and others experienced through the process, in mailing lists and even on official candidate pages, there is a desperate need for a well-trained & experienced community manager to deal with the rampant toxicity present in the community.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>My congratulations to the newly elected (or re-elected) board members. I'm looking forward to working with you all in the future.</p>
