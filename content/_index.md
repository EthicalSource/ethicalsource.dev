The Organization for Ethical Source (OES) is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit public charity organization focusing on ethical outcomes in open source, the digital commons, and other public interest technologies. 

OES is the steward of <a href="https://contributor-covenant.org">Contributor Covenant</a>, the first and most popular code of conduct for digital communities. Contributor Covenant has been adopted by thousands of open source communities, including 9 of the 10 largest open source projects in the world. We are also the creators of the <a href="https://firstdonoharm.dev">Hippocratic License</a>, the leading ethical open license, and other tools that comprise the <a href="/what-we-do">Ethical Stack</a>.

We are a community of technologists, social scientists, activists, legal experts, and human rights workers, united in our conviction that centering valu es of diversity, equity, and justice in the digital commons, we can create technology that promotes the well-being and the fundamental human rights of all.

We rely on <a href="https://opencollective.com/ethical-source">individual giving</a> and institutional funding to support the work that we do.
