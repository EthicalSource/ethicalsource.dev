The Organization for Ethical Source (OES) is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit public charity focusing on ethical outcomes in open source and other public interest technologies. 

OES is the steward of <a href="https://contributor-covenant.org">Contributor Covenant</a>, the first and most popular code of conduct for digital spaces. Contributor Covenant has been adopted by thousands of technology communities, including 9 of the 10 largest open source projects in the world.

We are a community of technologists, social scientists, activists, legal experts, and human rights workers, united in our conviction that centering values of diversity, equity, and justice in creator communities, we can make technology that promotes well-being and protects fundamental human rights.

OES relies on individual giving and institutional funding to support our work. Will you help us by <a href="https://opencollective.com/ethical-source">making a one-time or recurring donation</a>?
