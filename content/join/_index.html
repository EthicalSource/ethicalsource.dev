<p>
  We are a global community of open source maintainers and contributors, tech ethicists and advocates, legal experts, academics, sociologists, human rights workers, and more to come together to strategize about ways to center justice and equity in the software commons.
</p>

<p>
  By joining OES, you will have the opportunity to engage in critical conversations with other members of the community, suggest new projects or research areas, join (or even lead!) working groups, and participate in our governance activities.
