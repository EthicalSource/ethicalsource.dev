<h2>Ethical Source Principles</h2>
<p>
  We assure success in adhering to these principles through our impact rather than our intentions.

<p>
  The practice of Ethical Source is informed by these principles:
</p>

<ul id="principles-list">
  <li>
    <h3 class= "principles-title">1. Our work benefits the commons.</h3>
    <p>We grant permission to modify, create derivative works, use and reuse it, 
    in the spirit of openness and bounded by ethical constraints.</p>
  </li>
  <li >
    <h3 class= "principles-title">2. Our work is done in the open.</h3>
    <p>We make our source publicly available, develop and maintain it in public view, 
    and welcome public contributions.</p>
  </li>
  <li >
    <h3 class= "principles-title">3. Our community strives to be welcoming and just.</h3>
    <p>We practice transparent and just governance, and we consistently and fairly enforce
    a comprehensive code of conduct that codifies our values.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3 class= "principles-title">4. Our work respects accessibility as a human right.</h3>
    <p>We ensure that the full value of our work is available to everyone, regardless of ability.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3 class= "principles-title">5. Our work prioritizes the saftey of people.</h3>
    <p>We design safeguards to minimize the risk of abuse or harm to others through its use or misuse.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3 class= "principles-title">6. Our work protects privacy.</h3>
    <p>It stores as little personal data as necessary and incorporates reasonable security measures for its protection. 
    All personal data it collects can be deleted on request, and all such data can be delivered
    to its originator in an open and human-readable format.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3 class= "principles-title">7. Our work deserves support.</h3>
    <p>We believe in the dignity of our work. When it is used for commercial gain, we rightfully 
    expect those who profit from it to contribute back to its source and support our community
    in other tangible ways.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
