# Governance of the Ethical Source Movement community
This document specifies the interim governance of our community, with the knowledge that in the future more comprehensive representation and leadership bylawys may be drafted.

## Basics

Coraline Ada Ehmke (coraline@idolhands.com), the benevolent dictator for life (BDFL), holds ultimate decision-making power while seeking to represent a balance of the views and the best interests of the community as a whole.

Coraline has also nominated Tobie Langel and Don Goodman-Wilson as representatives of the broader Ethical Source community, and they also hold authority in the community.

## Participants

Membership is open to anyone who wants to join in the spirit of collaboration rather than confrontation.

The BDFL can remove members for code of conduct violations or at will for the sake of the common good.

In the event that the BDFL is unable or unwilling to continue leadership, the BDFL may appoint a new BDFL or choose to alter the governance structure entirely.

## Policy

The BDFL sets the community's policies and makes decisions for the community, taking reasonable account of input from other community members.

The BDFL is responsible for implementing—or delegating implementation of—policies and other decisions.

If members are not happy with the BDFL's leadership, they are free to voice their concerns or leave the community.

## Process

Community members are free to discuss and debate community policies, practices, and culture.

## Evolution

The BDFL can change the governance structure of the community at will.
