# Governance of the Ethical Source Movement community
This document specifies the interim governance of our community, with the knowledge that in the future more comprehensive representation and leadership bylaws will be drafted.

## Basics

For now, one community member (Coraline Ada Ehmke) is the benevolent dictator (BD), and holds ultimate decision-making power, until the community is ready for a more inclusive model. In the interim, she is responsible for representing a balance of the views and the best interests of the community as a whole.

Coraline has appointed Tobie Langel and Don Goodman-Wilson as authoritative representatives of the broader Ethical Source community, and they are empowered to make decisions for the community with her oversight.

## Participants

Membership is open to anyone who wants to join in the spirit of collaboration rather than confrontation.

The BD can remove members for code of conduct violations or at will for the sake of the common good.

In the event that the BD is unable or unwilling to continue leadership, the BD may appoint a new BD or choose to alter the governance structure entirely.

## Policy

The BD sets the community's policies and makes decisions for the community, taking reasonable account of input from other community members.

The BD is responsible for implementing—or delegating implementation of—policies and other decisions.

If members are not happy with the BD's leadership, they are free to voice their concerns or leave the community.

## Process

Community members are free to discuss and debate community policies, practices, and culture.

## Evolution

When a formal organization is incorporated, its leadership will assume control of the community. This control is activated upon the leadership of the organization, including the BD, unanimously adopting a revised Role that specifies how the Board will be chosen and make policy. Until then, the BD can change the governance structure of the community at will.
